representing context information about photographs. It enables the reader to see what is happening in the photograph, why the photographer made it and under what conditions.\n\n        p Ex-New York Times Photo Editor [Fred Ritchin], proposed the idea in his book `After Photography`. He envisaged each corner of an image providing access to extra information; top left would be the frames before and after, top right would be links to further, related information. Bottom left would be the background-story of the image and bottom right would be the photographer’s name, copyright terms and, their code of ethics.\n\n        p We’re using 4C because it shifts the role of the photographer from being suppliers of content to becoming publishers, and allows the reader to interregate the photograph in a richer way.**\n\n      .main-container.main-container-padded.background-white\n      \n        four-corners-interaction\n\n      .main-container.main-container-padded.background-white#get-started\n      \n        h1.content-title Get Started\n\n        p We have worked to make the experience of adding FourCorners images to your website as easy as possible.
