\"ARCHIVES\", title: \"Saigon Execution\", text: \"[From Wikipedia] It was while covering the Vietnam War for the Associated Press that he took his best-known photograph â€“ the picture of police chief General Nguyá»…n Ngá»c Loan executing a Vietcong prisoner, Nguyá»…n VÄƒn LÃ©m, on a Saigon street, on February 1, 1968, during the opening stages of the Tet Offensive. Adams won the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography and a World Press Photo award for the photograph (captioned 'General Nguyen Ngoc Loan executing a Viet Cong prisoner in Saigon'), but would later lament its notoriety.[6] Writer and critic David D. Perlmutter points out that 'no film footage did as much damage as AP photographer Eddie Adams's 35mm shot taken on a Saigon street ... When people talk or write about [the Tet Offensive] at least a sentence is devoted (often with an illustration) to the Eddie Adams picture'.[7] Anticipating the impact of Adams's photograph, an attempt at balance was sought by editors in the New York Times. In his memoirs,[8] John G. Morris recalls that assistant managing editor Theodore M. Bernstein \\\"determined that the brutality manifested by America's ally be put into perspective, agreed to run the Adams picture large, but offset with a picture of a child slain by Vietcong, which conveniently came through from AP at about the same time\\\". Nonetheless, it is Adams's photograph that is remembered while the other far less dramatic image was overlooked and soon forgotten. In Regarding the Pain of Others, Susan Sontag is disturbed by what she sees as the staged nature of the photograph. She writes that 'he would not have carried out the summary execution there had [the press] not been available to witness it'.[9] However, Donald Winslow of the New York Times quotes Adams as having described the image as a 'reflex picture' and 'wasn't certain of what he'd photographed until the film was developed'. Furthermore, Winslow notes that Adams 'wanted me to understand that â€œSaigon Executionâ€ was not his most important picture and that he did not want his obituary to begin, â€œEddie Adams, the photographer best known for his iconic Vietnam photograph â€˜Saigon Executionâ€™'.\", src: \"img/1-1.jpg\", author: \"Eddie Adams/Â© Associated Press\", capture: \"Police Chief General Nguyen Ngoc Loan executing a Vietcong officer captured in Saigon, February 1, 1968.\", context: { selectedIndex: 1, items: [{ src: \"img/1-0.jpg\", credit: \"Eddie Adams/AP\" }, { src: \"img/1-1.jpg\", credit: \"Eddie Adams/AP\" }, { src: \"img/1-2.jpg\", credit: \"Eddie Adams/AP\" }, { youtube_id: \"S9Jy3cLmqrE\", text: \"MrCleatsketch.

Photographs of his body were taken by Turkish journalist NilÃ¼fer Demir and quickly spread around the world, prompting international responses.[4] Because KurdÃ®'s family had reportedly been trying to reach Canada, his death and the wider refugee crisis immediately became an issue in the 2015 Canadian federal election. In the early hours of 2 September 2015, Kurdi and his family boarded a small plastic or rubber inflatable boat,[18] which capsized about five minutes after leaving Bodrum in Turkey. Sixteen people were in the boat, which was designed for a maximum of eight people. They were trying to reach the Greek island of Kos, about 30 minutes (4 kilometres or 2 1â„2 miles) from Bodrum.[18] Kurdi's father said: \\\"We had no life vests\\\",[19] but also said they were wearing life jackets, but they \\\"were all fake\\\".[20] Others have stated that they believed that they were wearing lifejackets but the items were ineffective.[5] It was later stated on Syrian radio that the Kurdi family paid $5,860 for their four spaces on the boat, which had twelve passengers on it despite being only about five meters long. Alan Kurdi's mother joined in the trip even though she had a fear of being on the open sea.[21] Tima Kurdi, Alan Kurdi's aunt, advised her sister not to go. The individuals on the boat evaded the Turkish coast guard by setting out from an isolated beach, going out late at night.[5] Around 5 am authorities started an investigation, after an emergency call that a boat had capsized and bodies were coming ashore.[22] The bodies of Kurdi and another child were discovered by two locals at around 6:30 am on the same morning.[23] The two men moved the bodies from the water onto the dry part of the beach.[23] Later, Kurdi was photographed face-down on the water's edge by a Turkish press photographer.[23][24][25] On 3 September 2015, Kurdi along with brother Galib and mother Rehana were taken to KobanÃ® for burials,[26] which took place the next day. It is Islamic tradition to bury the dead within 24 hours if possible.[27] The Siege of KobanÃ® ended in March 2015 and Islamic State attacks on what was left of the city[28] stopped completely in August 2015.\", src: \"img/2-1.jpg\", author: \"NilÃ¼fer Demir/DHA\", capture: \"A Turkish officer near the body of Alan Kurdi, a 3-year-old Syrian refugee who drowned off Turkeyâ€™s Bodrum Peninsula.

the picture of police chief General Nguyá»…n Ngá»c Loan executing a Vietcong prisoner, Nguyá»…n VÄƒn LÃ©m, on a Saigon street, on February 1, 1968, during the opening stages of the Tet Offensive. Adams won the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography and a World Press Photo award for the photograph (captioned 'General Nguyen Ngoc Loan executing a Viet Cong prisoner in Saigon'), but would later lament its notoriety.[6] Writer and critic David D. Perlmutter points out that 'no film footage did as much damage as AP photographer Eddie Adams's 35mm shot taken on a Saigon street ... When people talk or write about [the Tet Offensive] at least a sentence is devoted (often with an illustration) to the Eddie Adams picture'.[7] Anticipating the impact of Adams's photograph, an attempt at balance was sought by editors in the New York Times. In his memoirs,[8] John G. Morris recalls that assistant managing editor Theodore M. Bernstein \\\"determined that the brutality manifested by America's ally be put into perspective, agreed to run the Adams picture large, but offset with a picture of a child slain by Vietcong, which conveniently came through from AP at about the same time\\\". Nonetheless, it is Adams's photograph that is remembered while the other far less dramatic image was overlooked and soon forgotten. In Regarding the Pain of Others, Susan Sontag is disturbed by what she sees as the staged nature of the photograph. She writes that 'he would not have carried out the summary execution there had [the press] not been available to witness it'.[9] However, Donald Winslow of the New York Times quotes Adams as having described the image as a 'reflex picture' and 'wasn't certain of what he'd photographed until the film was developed'. Furthermore, Winslow notes that Adams 'wanted me to understand that â€œSaigon Executionâ€ was not his most important picture and that he did not want his obituary to begin, â€œEddie Adams, the photographer best known for his iconic Vietnam photograph â€˜Saigon Executionâ€™'.\",src:\"img/1-1.jpg\",author:\"Eddie Adams/Â© Associated Press\",capture:\"Police Chief General Nguyen Ngoc Loan executing a Vietcong officer captured in Saigon, February 1, 1968.\",context:{selectedIndex:1,items:[{src:\"img/1-0.jpg\",credit:\"Eddie Adams/AP\"},{src:\"img/1-1.jpg\",credit:\"Eddie Adams/AP\"},{src:\"img/1-2.jpg\",credit:\"Eddie Adams/AP\"},{youtube_id:\"S9Jy3cLmqrE\",text:\"MrCleatsketch.

Photographs of his body were taken by Turkish journalist NilÃ¼fer Demir and quickly spread around the world, prompting international responses.[4] Because KurdÃ®'s family had reportedly been trying to reach Canada, his death and the wider refugee crisis immediately became an issue in the 2015 Canadian federal election. In the early hours of 2 September 2015, Kurdi and his family boarded a small plastic or rubber inflatable boat,[18] which capsized about five minutes after leaving Bodrum in Turkey. Sixteen people were in the boat, which was designed for a maximum of eight people. They were trying to reach the Greek island of Kos, about 30 minutes (4 kilometres or 2 1â„2 miles) from Bodrum.[18] Kurdi's father said: \\\"We had no life vests\\\",[19] but also said they were wearing life jackets, but they \\\"were all fake\\\".[20] Others have stated that they believed that they were wearing lifejackets but the items were ineffective.[5] It was later stated on Syrian radio that the Kurdi family paid $5,860 for their four spaces on the boat, which had twelve passengers on it despite being only about five meters long. Alan Kurdi's mother joined in the trip even though she had a fear of being on the open sea.[21] Tima Kurdi, Alan Kurdi's aunt, advised her sister not to go. The individuals on the boat evaded the Turkish coast guard by setting out from an isolated beach, going out late at night.[5] Around 5 am authorities started an investigation, after an emergency call that a boat had capsized and bodies were coming ashore.[22] The bodies of Kurdi and another child were discovered by two locals at around 6:30 am on the same morning.[23] The two men moved the bodies from the water onto the dry part of the beach.[23] Later, Kurdi was photographed face-down on the water's edge by a Turkish press photographer.[23][24][25] On 3 September 2015, Kurdi along with brother Galib and mother Rehana were taken to KobanÃ® for burials,[26] which took place the next day. It is Islamic tradition to bury the dead within 24 hours if possible.[27] The Siege of KobanÃ® ended in March 2015 and Islamic State attacks on what was left of the city[28] stopped completely in August 2015.\",src:\"img/2-1.jpg\",author:\"NilÃ¼fer Demir/DHA\",capture:\"A Turkish officer near the body of Alan Kurdi, a 3-year-old Syrian refugee who drowned off Turkeyâ€™s Bodrum Peninsula.
